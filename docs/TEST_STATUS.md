# DuckDB OrmLite Provider - Test Status

## Overall Results
- **Total Tests**: 25
- **Passed**: 3 ✅
- **Failed**: 22 ❌
- **Success Rate**: 12%

## ✅ Passing Tests (3/25)
1. `Can_Create_Connection` - Successfully connects to DuckDB
2. `Can_Create_Table_With_Basic_Types` - Table creation works with proper schema  
3. `Can_Check_Table_Exists` - Can query information_schema

## ❌ Failing Tests (22/25)

All failures are due to: **Parser Error: syntax error at or near "Name"**

This indicates that INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements have issues with column name quoting or reserved words.

### Root Cause
DuckDB is encountering SQL syntax errors when executing INSERT statements. The error suggests unquoted column names that may be reserved words (like "Name", "Age", etc.).

### What's Working
- ✅ DuckDB native library loaded (using DuckDB.NET.Data.Full)
- ✅ Connection creation
- ✅ Table creation with CREATE TABLE statements
- ✅ Schema queries
- ✅ All type converters registered (int, long, string, Guid, DateTime, etc.)
- ✅ Parameter syntax (using `?` instead of `$`)

### What Needs Fixing
- ❌ INSERT statement generation (column quoting issues)
- ❌ UPDATE statement generation  
- ❌ DELETE statement generation
- ❌ SELECT with WHERE clauses

## Technical Details

### Working SQL
```sql
CREATE TABLE "BasicTypeTest" (
  "Id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  "Name" VARCHAR,
  "Age" INTEGER,
  ...
)
```

### Failing SQL (suspected)
```sql
INSERT INTO "BasicTypeTest" (Name, Age, ...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)
-- Error: syntax error at or near "Name"
```

The issue is likely that column names in INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements aren't being quoted, even though GetQuotedColumnName() is implemented.

## Next Steps
1. Override SQL generation methods for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE to ensure proper quoting
2. Or investigate why OrmLite isn't using GetQuotedColumnName() for DML statements
3. Add integration with DuckDB's specific SQL dialect requirements
